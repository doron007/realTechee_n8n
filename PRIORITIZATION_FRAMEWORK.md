## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Task | Technical Risk | Design Risk | Scope Creep Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Fix modal | Low | None | None | Quick fix, isolated component |
| Design system | Medium | High | High | Use Apple's exact palette - no debate |
| Theme toggle | Medium | Low | Medium | Use next-themes library, proven pattern |
| CSS refactor | High | Medium | Medium | Keep backup, test incrementally |
| Homepage redesign | Low | High | High | Timebox to 1 day, "good enough" mindset |
| X Insights redesign | Medium | High | High | Focus on layout, not perfection |
| Polish | Low | Low | High | Set 2-hour time limit, no more |
| Testing | Low | None | Low | Standard QA process |

### Risk Definitions

**Technical Risk**: Likelihood of bugs or implementation challenges
- High: Touches many files, complex logic, unclear solution
- Medium: Some complexity, needs careful testing
- Low: Isolated change, straightforward implementation

**Design Risk**: Likelihood of design decisions taking too long or being wrong
- High: Many possible approaches, subjective choices
- Medium: Some uncertainty, may need iteration
- Low: Clear design pattern exists

**Scope Creep Risk**: Likelihood of task expanding beyond initial plan
- High: Loosely defined, many "while we're here" opportunities
- Medium: Some gray areas in scope
- Low: Clear boundaries, specific deliverable

## Decision Framework for Day-to-Day Prioritization

### When to Make a Decision

Use this flowchart when deciding what to work on next:

```
Is there a P0 bug?
  └─ YES → Fix it immediately
  └─ NO → Continue

Is foundation work (P1) complete?
  └─ NO → Work on foundation
  └─ YES → Continue

Are core features (P2) complete?
  └─ NO → Work on core features
  └─ YES → Continue

Is there time for polish (P3)?
  └─ YES → Add finishing touches
  └─ NO → Ship it
```

### When to Cut Scope

Cut a task if ANY of these are true:
- You've spent 2x estimated time and not 50% complete
- It's blocking other high-priority work
- It doesn't directly contribute to sprint goal
- There's a simpler solution that achieves 80% of the value

### When to Add Scope

Only add if ALL of these are true:
- You've completed all P0 and P1 items
- You have >1 day remaining in sprint
- The new task directly supports sprint goal
- The new task takes <4 hours
- Stakeholders have approved the addition

---

## Sprint Velocity & Capacity Planning

### Assumptions
- 1 developer working full-time
- 6 working days available
- 6 hours productive time per day (accounting for meetings, breaks, etc.)
- Total capacity: 36 hours

### Time Allocation by Priority

| Priority | Hours Allocated | % of Sprint | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| P0 | 2 hours | 6% | Critical bug fix - must ship first |
| P1 | 16 hours | 44% | Foundation enables all other work |
| P2 | 14 hours | 39% | Core deliverables, main sprint value |
| P3 | 4 hours | 11% | Polish and quality, nice-to-have |

### Task Time Estimates

| Day | Task | Estimated Hours | Buffer | Total |
|-----|------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fix modal + Design system start | 5 | 1 | 6 |
| 2 | Theme toggle + CSS refactor | 5 | 1 | 6 |
| 3 | Homepage redesign | 5 | 1 | 6 |
| 4 | X Insights redesign | 5 | 1 | 6 |
| 5 | Polish + Responsive testing | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| 6 | Testing + Documentation | 4 | 2 | 6 |

**Buffer Justification**: 17% buffer for unexpected issues, meetings, and context switching

## Kano Model Feature Categorization

### Must-Haves (Dissatisfiers)
If missing, users will be very disappointed
- Modal text visibility fix
- Basic theme toggle functionality
- No broken functionality from redesign

### Performance Features (Satisfiers)
More is better, linear satisfaction
- Number of pages redesigned (2 > 1)
- Consistency across light/dark themes
- Animation smoothness

### Delighters (Exciters)
Unexpected features that delight users
- Smooth theme transitions
- System preference detection
- Polished micro-interactions
- Copy button in modal

**Strategy**: Ensure all Must-Haves shipped by Day 2, Performance Features by Day 4, Delighters by Day 6 if time permits

## Trade-Off Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Apple Palette vs Custom Colors
**Choice**: Use Apple's exact color palette
**Rationale**: Eliminates design decision paralysis, proven to work, saves 4-6 hours
**Trade-off**: Less brand uniqueness
**Verdict**: Worth it - speed to market more valuable

### Decision 2: Two Pages vs All Pages
**Choice**: Redesign homepage and X Insights only
**Rationale**: 80% of user traffic, achieves sprint goal, realistic in 6 days
**Trade-off**: Design Agent and Prompt Agent remain old style
**Verdict**: Accept - can be follow-up sprint

### Decision 3: Perfect Animations vs Good Enough
**Choice**: Simple, subtle animations only
**Rationale**: Minimalism aligns with Apple aesthetic, saves time
**Trade-off**: Less "wow factor"
**Verdict**: Accept - minimalism is the goal

### Decision 4: Build Theme System vs Use Library
**Choice**: Use next-themes library
**Rationale**: Battle-tested, handles SSR, saves 1-2 days
**Trade-off**: One more dependency
**Verdict**: Worth it - focus on design, not infrastructure

### Decision 5: Comprehensive Testing vs MVP Testing
**Choice**: Focus testing on critical paths and themes
**Rationale**: 6-day sprint demands pragmatism
**Trade-off**: May miss edge cases
**Verdict**: Accept - can iterate based on user feedback

## When Things Go Wrong: Emergency Protocols

### Scenario 1: Fell Behind Schedule
**Trigger**: End of Day 3, <50% of P2 work complete
**Action**:
1. Cut P3 tasks entirely
2. Simplify P2 designs (less polish)
3. Focus on one page only (X Insights - higher traffic)
4. Extend sprint by 1 day if critical

### Scenario 2: Theme Toggle Breaking Everything
**Trigger**: Dark mode causes widespread visual issues
**Action**:
1. Remove theme toggle feature
2. Ship light mode only with fixed modal
3. Still valuable - fixes critical bug and improves design
4. Add dark mode in future sprint

### Scenario 3: Design Paralysis
**Trigger**: Spending >1 hour debating color or spacing
**Action**:
1. Stop immediately
2. Copy Apple.com exactly - use their values
3. Use design system reference doc
4. No custom values - only documented values

### Scenario 4: Scope Creep
**Trigger**: Adding features not in sprint plan
**Action**:
1. Acknowledge the idea
2. Add to "Post-Sprint Backlog"
3. Commit to current plan
4. Review after sprint complete

---

## Final Prioritization: First 3 Days vs Last 3 Days

### Days 1-3: MUST SHIP
These are non-negotiable - if you can't finish Days 4-6, the sprint is still successful:

1. Modal visibility fix (2 hours)
2. Design system definition (4 hours)
3. Theme toggle implementation (6 hours)
4. CSS refactoring (6 hours)
5. Homepage basic redesign (4 hours)

**Total: 22 hours (Day 1-3 capacity: 18 hours)**

### Days 4-6: SHOULD SHIP
These add significant value but aren't deal-breakers:

1. X Insights redesign (6 hours)
2. Modal complete overhaul (4 hours)
3. Animation polish (2 hours)
4. Testing (4 hours)
5. Documentation (2 hours)

**Total: 18 hours (Day 4-6 capacity: 18 hours)**

---

## Conclusion

**Sprint Strategy**: Front-load critical work, maintain buffer, be ready to cut scope.

**Success Definition**:
- Minimum: Modal fixed, theme toggle working, homepage redesigned
- Target: + X Insights redesigned, animations polished
- Stretch: + comprehensive testing, full documentation

**Key Principle**: "Ship working software incrementally. Perfect is the enemy of done."

Use this framework daily to make prioritization decisions. When in doubt, refer to RICE scores and sprint goal.
